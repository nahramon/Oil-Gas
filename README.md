# Analyzing Oil & Gas Production Data with Python

In this project, we delve into oil and gas production data, aiming to understand production trends and generate relevant indicators. The data encompasses production figures by basin, province, company, and type of resource.

## Data Import:

We start by importing the production data from a website using Python's pandas library. The data is stored in a DataFrame for further analysis.

## Data Exploration:

We conduct an initial exploration of the dataset, examining its structure and contents. This step involves checking for null values, validating data types, and gaining insights into the completeness of information.

## Data Transformation:

To prepare the data for analysis, we perform several transformation steps. This includes removing unnecessary columns, handling null values, renaming columns for clarity, and converting date columns to datetime format.

## Production Analysis:

We analyze oil and gas production trends over time by grouping data based on production dates. This allows us to visualize production trends and identify any notable patterns or fluctuations.

## Data Cleaning:

We clean the dataset by removing rows with null or irrelevant values in key columns such as 'tipoextraccion' and 'tipo_de_recurso'. This ensures that our analysis is based on reliable and relevant data.

## Conclusion:

By analyzing oil and gas production data using Python, we aim to uncover insights into production trends, identify key drivers of production, and generate actionable insights for stakeholders in the oil and gas industry.
